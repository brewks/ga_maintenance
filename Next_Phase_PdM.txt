✅ **Fantastic progress! Your dashboard is up and running — that’s a big milestone!**
Now, let’s outline what’s next to elevate your PdM project from functional prototype to robust system:

---

## 🚀 **Next Steps for Your PdM Project**

---

### 1️⃣ **Test + Refine Model Performance**

* ✅ Review prediction accuracy on real or synthetic datasets.
* ✅ Try adjusting:

  * **Sequence length** (e.g., 10 → 30 steps for LSTM)
  * **RF hyperparameters** (e.g., n\_estimators, max\_depth)
  * **LSTM layers** (e.g., add dropout, stacked layers)
* ✅ Validate against known RUL values (even simulated).

---

### 2️⃣ **Enhance Database Logging**

* ✅ Store:

  * Model version, training date
  * Input feature summaries
  * Any errors or anomalies flagged during prediction
* ✅ Make sure triggers + constraints fire as expected (test with mock failure cases).

---

### 3️⃣ **Strengthen Regulatory Compliance**

* ✅ Integrate **AC 43-12** guidance explicitly:

  * Define thresholds in the database (e.g., create or populate `preventive_tasks`, `pdm_task_mapping`).
  * Link predictions to recommended tasks + alerts.
* ✅ Plan integration of manufacturer references (AMM, MPD, etc).

---

### 4️⃣ **Deploy / Package**

* ✅ Create a `.pkl` or `.h5` package for deployment.
* ✅ Containerize (optional): Docker for portability.
* ✅ Set up auto-refresh on the Streamlit app (or schedule retrains).

---

### 5️⃣ **Documentation + Collaboration**

* ✅ Document:

  * Data flow (sensor → DB → model → dashboard)
  * Model assumptions + limitations
  * How regulatory logic is applied
* ✅ Prepare for sharing with collaborators, e.g. flight schools, MROs.

## 📝 **Suggested Immediate Action**

If you like, I can:
👉 **Generate SQL to define preventive task mappings (AC 43-12)**
👉 **Prepare a deployment checklist (e.g., Dockerfile, Streamlit cloud, etc)**
👉 **Draft a technical summary for stakeholders**

💬 **What would you like to focus on next?**

* Integrate compliance logic?
* Package + deploy the app?
* Improve model accuracy?
* Prepare presentation/reporting material?
